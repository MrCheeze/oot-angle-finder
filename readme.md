modify `starting_angles` to have accessible angles (usually cardinals and nearby walls)

modify `destination_angles` with any angle you'd like to find (will change this later to find all instead of stop of first find)

modify `types` with the allowed movement options

modify `max_ess` to what you'd like to do max per section of a setup
